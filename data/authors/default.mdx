Welcome to my corner of the internet! This site serves as a playground for me to experiment
with ideas and share some of my findings. It's a reflection of my career path and
interests - especially on the technical side of things. For more information on my career path, check
out my [Linkedin profile](https://linkedin.com/in/justin-a-smith662).

I am currently a Senior Data Engineer at [Camgian](https://camgian.com) where I work on a variety of 
projects ranging from full-stack web development to data pipelines and general DevOps. I have a passion for
learning and enjoy working on projects that allow me to explore new technologies and ideas.

My current interests are in the areas of Web3 security, full-stack development,
and solopreneurship so expect to see more of these topics in the future! This site is
bootstrapped from this [starter blog template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog)
and will contain many new design and feature updates to add my unique touch. Source code for the website
is available at my [Github page](https://github.com/JustinASmith/justinsmith.sh).
